# This is my friend's web page 
## The page is built with it's own backend and database 
if it isn't working don't blame me (Michał isn't paying for storage or other stuff so why should I)

So why do I think it is a good page (I don't) it has it's own something like CMS that allows users to manipulate dynamically content of the web page
Backend is using aws api and mongodb database whole app is built using ts :D

Why is it public? Because dear Michał doesn't care about this project.
